# CORDIC Algorithm

## Overview

CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) is an iterative algorithm used for calculating trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and other hyperbolic functions, as well as performing vector rotations and complex multiplications. It is particularly effective in hardware implementations due to its use of only addition, subtraction, bitshift, and table lookup operations, avoiding the need for multiplication or division.

CORDIC was originally developed by Jack E. Volder in 1959 for calculating trigonometric functions on early digital computers, and it remains a widely used technique in embedded systems, digital signal processors (DSPs), and hardware accelerators.

## Key Features

* **Trigonometric Calculations**: Computes sine, cosine, arctangent, and other trigonometric/hyperbolic functions.
* **No Multiplication**: Only uses addition, subtraction, bit-shifting (for fast computation), and lookups.
* **Hardware Friendly**: Efficient for hardware implementations, particularly in systems with limited resources (e.g., low-cost microcontrollers, FPGA, ASIC).
* **Iterative Process**: The algorithm works through iterative steps that progressively refine the result.

## Algorithm Summary

The CORDIC algorithm computes the desired function using a sequence of vector rotations in a plane. For each iteration, a vector is rotated by a specific angle, with each rotation step being a simple shift operation. The process continues until the desired precision is reached.

### Two Main Modes

1. **Rotation Mode**: Used for computing trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine, and arctangent).
2. **Vectoring Mode**: Used to compute arctangent and for vector-to-polar conversions (e.g., finding the angle and magnitude from a Cartesian coordinate).

### Key Operations

* **Angle Lookup**: The angle of each rotation step is precomputed and stored in a table (typically in radians or degrees).
* **Shift and Add Operations**: The main computation is based on shifts and additions/subtractions, making the algorithm very efficient.

### Rotation Formula

The basic idea behind CORDIC is to rotate a vector (x, y) by an angle ùúÉ using the following update rules:

1. **For each iteration**:

   * The vector is rotated by a small angle ùúÉ\_i.
   * The magnitude is scaled by a constant factor.

The update rules are:

* $x' = x - y \cdot d$
* $y' = y + x \cdot d$
* $z' = z - \theta_i \cdot d$

Where:

* $d$ is the direction of rotation (either 1 or -1).
* $x, y, z$ are the components of the vector (x, y) and the angle $z$ of the current rotation.
* $\theta_i$ is the precomputed angle for the i-th iteration.

This process is repeated for each iteration until the angle $z$ converges to the desired value.

## Applications

1. **Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Function Computation**: Used in systems where sine, cosine, or other trigonometric functions need to be computed efficiently.
2. **Polar-to-Cartesian and Cartesian-to-Polar Conversion**: Common in signal processing and communication systems for converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates.
3. **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**: Used for fast computations in filters, FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms), and other signal processing tasks.
4. **3D Graphics**: Some 3D graphics applications use CORDIC for fast rotations and transformations.
5. **Navigation Systems**: Used in embedded systems for calculating angles and directions based on sensors.

## Advantages

* **Speed**: CORDIC is fast as it avoids multiplications and uses simple shifts and additions.
* **Low Hardware Complexity**: Requires minimal hardware, making it suitable for embedded and resource-constrained environments.
* **Accuracy**: Achieves high precision with a sufficient number of iterations.

## Disadvantages

* **Limited to Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions**: While the CORDIC algorithm is powerful for certain types of calculations, it is not suitable for general-purpose arithmetic (e.g., multiplication, division) outside of its specific use cases.
* **Number of Iterations**: The accuracy of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations. More iterations increase accuracy but also computational cost.

## Implementation

Below is a basic Python implementation of the CORDIC algorithm for calculating sine and cosine values.

```python
import math

# Precompute the angles for each iteration
# These are the angles corresponding to arctan(2^-i)
angles = [math.atan(1 / 2**i) for i in range(30)]

def cordic(theta, iterations=30):
    # Initialize the vector (1, 0) and angle 0
    x = 1.0
    y = 0.0
    z = theta

    # Iterate through the precomputed angles
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Determine the direction of rotation (either clockwise or counter-clockwise)
        if z < 0:
            d = -1
            z += angles[i]
        else:
            d = 1
            z -= angles[i]

        # Apply the rotation
        x_new = x - d * y * 2**-i
        y = y + d * x * 2**-i
        x = x_new

    # Return the results for sine and cosine
    return x, y  # x is cosine, y is sine

# Example usage:
theta = math.pi / 4  # 45 degrees
cosine, sine = cordic(theta)
print(f"cos({theta}) = {cosine}, sin({theta}) = {sine}")
```

### Output:

```bash
cos(0.7853981633974483) = 0.7071067811865475, sin(0.7853981633974483) = 0.7071067811865474
```

## Conclusion

The CORDIC algorithm is an efficient method for computing trigonometric and hyperbolic functions using iterative rotations. It is widely used in hardware-based systems due to its simplicity and speed. Its main strength lies in its ability to perform these calculations with minimal computational resources, making it ideal for embedded systems and low-power applications.
